    "## Remote sensing is the science of identifying, observing, collecting and measuring objects without coming into direct contact with them.\n",
    "## eg of devices used for this; Airborne Instruments, UAVS, Mobile Rovers, sensors abroad the ISS, Major Satellite Missions, Signals of Opportunity, Doppler Radar, Smart phones & Citizen Science, Stratospheric Ballons, HD Videos, Cubesats, etc\n",
    "## Sensors on board satellites also record the electromagnetic energy that is reflected or emitted from objects on Earth\n",
    "## Passive and Active Sensors\n",
    "## Passive remote sensors record the natural energy that is (naturally) reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface (eg. sunlights, moonlight, city lights)\n",
    "##Active sensors provide their own energy source for  illumination (e.g . RADAR, LIDAR)\n",
    "## Spatial resolution signifies the ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image; \n",
    "# Notes; WE use VIIRS-DNB(Visible and infrared radiometer) 750m and DMSP-OLS VNIR band data (an oscillating scan radiometer with 2 spectral bands, a Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) band that has low-light imaging capabilities, and a long-wave thermal infrared (TIR) band.) 2.7km.\n",
    "## Spectral resolution; signifies the number and width of spectral bands of the sensor. The higher the spectral resolution, the narrower the wavelength range for a given channel or band.\n",
    "## Temporal resolution refers to the repeat cycle, or frequency, with which a sensor revisits the same part of the Earth’s surface. You might hear this referred to as a satellite’s “revisit time.”\n",
    "## Trade offs in remote sensing resolution; There is an inherent tradeoff between spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. Typically, the higher the spatial resolution, the lower the spectral and the temporal resolution and the higher the temporal resolution, the lower the spatial and spectral resolutions\n",
    "## Remotely sensed observations are useful for a wide-range of economic research applications. z.B...........\n",
    "# Advantages of using remotely sensed data for economic studies: Improved accessibility to information difficult to obtain byy other means, Higher spatial resolution, Wide geographic coverage and high temporal resolution etc\n",
    "## Nighttimelights are especially useful for variety of socio-economic research and applications. There is a strong correlation between nighttime lights and Gross  State Product (GSP) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to measure national, state and regional levels or even at a more granular resolution.\n",
    "# Uses: used as a proxy for economic activity, especially over periods or regions where these data are not available or where the statistical systems are of low quality or when no recent population or economic censuses are available. Similarly, changes in nighttime light intensity can be used by economists as an additional measure of income growth when no other measures of income growth are available.\n",
    "## Comparing nighttime lights and a series of socio-economic indicators: Proville et al. (2017) examined trends observed by DMSP-OLS in the period 1992-2013 and their correlation with a series of socio-economic indicators. They found the strongest correlations between nighttime lights, electricity consumption, CO2 emissions, and GDP, followed by population, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, poverty and F-gas emissions."

    "#####################################Introduction to nighttime light data###############\n",
    "## Remotely sensed data of nighttime lights: Low-light imaging of the Earth from space has been a capability since the mid-1960s with sensors onboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite platforms.\n",
    "## DMSP is a United States Air Force series of polar-orbiting satellites with sensors onboard that were originally designed to observe weather-related indicators at day and night, in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges.\n",
    "## In 1973, Croft first reported that information collected with the DMSP Operational Linescan System’s (DMSP-OLS) Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) band was able to capture various sources of low-light emissions from Earth\n",
    "## In 1973, Croft [Cro73] first reported that information collected with the DMSP Operational Linescan System’s (DMSP-OLS) Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) band was able to capture various sources of low-light emissions from Earth.\n",
    "## These include sources that indicate aspects of human activity, like city lights, gas flares, fishing boats, and agricultural fires, while also capturing other nighttime lights phenomena such as auroras.\n",
    "\n",
    "#######DMSP-OLS#######\n",
    "# While the first low-light imagery from DMSP dates to the mid-1960’s, it was not until 1992 that a digital archive was established for these data at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) - formerly the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). \n",
    "# While all DMSP satellites are sun-synchronous polar-orbiting platforms, their overpass times vary. Depending on the overpass time, the DMSP satellites can be categorized as either a “day/night” or a “dawn/dusk” satellite. \n",
    "# The day/night satellites have one side of their orbits imaging the daytime side of the earth, and the other side imaging the nighttime side.\n",
    "# Similarly, the dawn/dusk satellites image an early morning earth on one side of their orbits and an early evening on the other side.\n",
    "# Notes: While the DMSP-OLS data from all the satellites contain some amount of nighttime data, the satellites in a day/night orbit have the highest quality nighttime data and are usually favored for nighttime lights use.\n",
    "# In 1992, when the creation of the digital archive began, there were two DMSP satellites collecting data, named F10 and F11. F10 was in a day/night orbit, and F11 was dawn/dusk. Since then, 8 other satellites have been launched, F12-F19, where F12, F14, F15, F16, and F18 were launched in day/night orbits.\n",
    "# Limittaion and challenges: its an old technology and has been essentially unchanged since 1976 with the start of the Block 5D series of DMSP satellites. The OLS VIS, the low-light imaging band, has only 6-bit quantization (its digital values range from 0-63). In addition, the OLS VIS band has no on-board calibration, so these 64 values are only relative values based on the gain in which the data were recorded.\n",
    "# Another limitation of the OLS is its very large spatial resolution. During the day, the OLS VIS band has a 2.7km spatial resolution, but at night things get more complicated. \n",
    "# note: it has a low radiometric resolution, noon-board calibration, saturation in urban cores, and it is often seen that the spatial resolution of the OLS  reported as 2.7km. It’s important to remember that for nighttime imagery that value is referring to the GSD and that the IFOV is the higher 4.9km value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##########VIIRS-DNB####################\n",
    "# DNB sensor is an improvemnt of OLS\n",
    "# The DNB sensors have a higher radiometric resolution (14-bit) and are capable of collecting at multiple gain setting simultaneously. These features eliminates the nighttime saturation in DNB.\n",
    "# The DNB has onboard calibration for the daytime data that is carried through to the nighttime side, yielding nighttime pixel values in radiance units.\n",
    "# The spatial resolution of the DNB sensor is ~750m on a side, making the spatial area of the DNB footprint 44 times smaller than the OLS.\n",
    "# The blooming effect of the OLS, as discussed earlier, is reduced in the DNB. However, blooming will still occur because of the coarse spatial resolution of the DNB sensor as compared to a lighting source, and the detection of diffuse and scattered light over areas containing no light source.\n",
    "# Limitation; VIIRS-DNB is still a fairly new sensor and algorithms for turning the raw nightly data into meaningful products for the research community has not had time to fully develop. While the DNB is a much improved version of the OLS sensor, it was still designed to be a weather satellite, with the low-light imaging capability tailored for detection of moonlit clouds, not nighttime lights. \n",
    "# The spatial resolution of the sensor at 742m is too large for many applications, like mapping of urban morphology and detection of very small human settlements.\n"

    "########Raster files\n",
    "# Data stored in a raster format is arranged in a regular gride of cells without storing the coordinates of each point. The coordinates of the corner points and the spacing of the grid can be used to calculate (rather than to store) the coordinates of each location in the grid.\n",
    "# A satellite image, an image you take with your camera or even a map layer you are looking at can be examples of geospatial data that are stored in a raster format. These images are composed of pixels that are organized in rows and columns, with values and location. The size of a given pixel depends on the spatial resolution of the sensor.\n",
    "# Raster files are often composed out of multiple bands (channels). Each band represents, for example, the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected from the surface on Earth along multiple regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
    "# Raster data is typically used to represent continuous surfaces, where knowing the exact boundaries in high precision is of less importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "########Vecctor files\n",
    "# Data in a vector format is stored in a way that the X and Y coordinates are stored for each point. Data can be represented, for example, as points, lines and polygons.\n",
    "# A point has only one coordinate (X and Y), a line has two coordinates (at the start and end of the line) and an area is essentially a line that closes on itself to enclose a region. Polygons are usually used to represent the area and perimeter of a continuous geographic features. Vector data stores features in their original resolution, without aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### GeoTIFF and Cloud-optimized geoTIFFs\n",
    "# A tagged Image File Format (TIFF or TIF) is a file format for storing raster files. A GeoTIFF is a TIFF file that follows a specific standard for structuring meta-data, such as georeference information (e.g. map coordinates) for the image. Most of the remote sensing data you encounter will be stored as a GeoTIFF file and we will explore to read these files later in the tutorial.\n",
    "# Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFS (COGs) are GeoTIFFs that have data structured in such a way that you can query these files through a web service. The major advantage of this is that you can query, analyze, visualize, or download just a part of a COG file online, without downloading the entire file.\n",
    "#The World Bank’s Light Every Night data set is a complete archive of all nighttime imagery captured each night over the last three decades. The underlying data is sourced from the NOAA/NCEI archive. The two sensors featured are the DMSP-OLS with data from 1992-2017, and the VIIRS-DNB with data spanning 2012-2020."
